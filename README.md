![Alt text](Chess.png?raw=true "Chess Application")

A chess application developed in Java. Gradle was used to deploy and test the application. The project was developed alongside a group of three other developers. We followed Agile-Scrum methodology and implemented features over two-week sprints for 12 weeks. My primary role was as a UI/UX developer. The chess GUI was based upon a number of paper prototypes and developed using NetBeans. To initialize the application execute "gradle run" from the application directory.
